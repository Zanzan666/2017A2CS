## About the code
### 1. Modules overview
```python
class AskForEquation():
	def __init__(self)
	def modeAsking(self):
	def mainFrameSetUp(self):
	def mainFrameSetUp(self):
	def translate(self):
class ploting():
	def __init__(self,coefficientList,mode):
	def defineEquation(self,coefficientList,mode):
	def draw(self):
```

## Development
### 1. Initial purpose
The idea of this program comes from sketching graphs in Further Maths. In Further Maths exams, we always encounter questions that require us to sketch a complicated graph, and drawing it point by point takes us too much time. Thus, we design this program, helping us to sketch the graph in a quicker and more accurate way. 
### 2. Recent ideas
1. Improve the previous code.
2. Improve the user interface, fewer possible run-time error, more input controls.
3. Allow more equations to be input at the same time.
4. Set a table to show important coordinates of the graph.
5. Add Cartesian Coordinates.
6. Animations.
### 3. Updates
1. Bugs fixed
2. Table added
3. Cartesian graph added
4. Better user interface
5. Fewer potential error
